#### General Information
This project analyzes a seattle Airbnb dataset using python to find answers to three business questions:
* What neighbourhood got the highest price?
* Is there a relationship between the (guest includedand) and the (rent price)?
* will hosts provide lower renting price if they make it mandatory for customers to verify their identity by picture or phone?


#### Files available
* Seattle Airbnb Dataset : 3818 Records x 72 Columns
* ReadMe file
* Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)

#### Dataset used
Seattle Airbnb | The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)

#### Tools used
##### Jupyter Notebook
* Python Version: 3.6.5
* Pandas Version: 0.23.0

##### Python Libraries Used
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* seaborn

#### Findings

After analyzing Seattle Airbnb Dataset and imposing three business questions, we can say that downtown got the highest renting price compared to other neighborhoods. We also can conclude that having more guests included in renting process will increase the total renting price. On the other hand, not verifying an Airbnb account with a phone number or a profile picture might be a factor in increasing renting prices by hosts.
